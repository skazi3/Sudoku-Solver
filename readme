In this version of the program, the user is able to:
  > Load and Save a file
  > Play the game; insert and erase cells
  > Display the lists of candidates for each cell clicked
  > Use the "check on fill" mode
  > Get hints using the 'single', 'hidden single', and 'naked pairs' algorithms
  
We were not able to complete the implementation of 'Locked Candidate' algorithm so the solve function only uses the three currently implemented.
